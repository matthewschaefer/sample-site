# OpenDNS coding test

No special instructions for implementing this site.

There's a lot more to complete here, but the implementation of the design is mostly complete

Backbone was used for MVC framework. For convenience's sake, hosted files were used

Not all areas templatized, however, the navigation items (top, footer, share, & social links) are as is the main conent area.

The blog page is missing, did not have time to complete, but much of the code would be reused from the similar main content area on the home page.

The "numbers we're proud of section" has problems. I attempted a css-only implementation, but I now feel it would benefit from a JavaScript treatment

Thanks for your time.
