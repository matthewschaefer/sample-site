# OpenDNS coding test
# 
# No special instructions for implementing this site.
# There's a lot more to complete here, but the implementation of the design is mostly complete
# Backbone was used for MVC framework. For convenience's sake, hosted files were used
# Not all areas templatized, however, the navigation items (top, footer, share, & social links) are as is the main conent area.
# the blog page is missing, did not have time to complete, but much of the code would be reused from the similar main content area on the home page.
# The "numbers we're proud of section" has problems. I attempted a css-only implementation, but I now feel it would benefit from a JavaScript treatment
#
# Thanks for your time.
